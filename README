the .jar file includes the following java documents-
SpaceShip.java- includes the abstract 'SpaceShip' class, from which all other ship-classes inherit.
SpaceShipFactory.java- a class responsible for producing the wanted ships for the game
HumanControlled.java- the class of the human controlled ship
Runner.java- the class of the runner ship
Basher.java- the class of the basher ship
Aggressive.java- the class of the aggressive ship
Drunkard.java- the class of the drunkard ship
Special.java- the class of the special ship

=============================

I chose to implement every type of spaceship as a different class, and make the SpaceShip class an abstract class,
from which all other spaceship type classes inherit. all classes use the SpaceShip methods as they are except the
doAction method and the getImage method, which only the HumanControlled class override.
this makes the program easily extensible and modular, due to the fact that creating a new type of ship only demands
implementing a new class and writing the relevant doAction method in the wanted way. this way of implemention saves
a large amount of spare code and creates an intuitive logical flow of the program. the SpaceShip class is abstract
because logically it is impossible to have a SpaceShip instance (same as having a generic animal).

=============================
Drunkard spaceship-
every instance of this class is randomizing a number-0, 1 or 2- every time the
doAction method is called. every 10th round the ship switches behaviour according to the randomized number, in the
following way- if 10 rounds passed, the turning policy will be the randomized number minus 1, (in that way every
possibility for the turning will be possible), if the number is 0 or 2 the accelerating will be activated, and it will
not be activated if the number is 1.
in every other option (meaning before 10 rounds passed since the policy was last changed), the ship will fire if
and only if the number is 0, and will try to activate the shield if and only if the number is 1. teleports will not be
attempted.

Special spaceship-
The behaviour of the special spaceship is- never accelerating, teleporting when possible, and shooting if it is not
possible to teleport. when the special ship is close to a different ship, it will attempt to activate the shield.
in addition, the firing of the special ship is not dependent on the rounds (there's no cool-down waiting), and it can
fire any time it desires (in condition that it has enough energy to shoot).
